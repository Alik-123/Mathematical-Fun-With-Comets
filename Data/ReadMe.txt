The following are the tarzipped FITS files of the comet ISON, taken on IIA HCT, Hanle, Leh 
in 2013. The tarballs contain:

JanCalib.tgz: two frames of the comet taken on January 22, 2013 (first and last in series)
 that are astrometrically calibrated. The comet is a small smudge in the centre of the field.

FebUncalibrated.tgz: six subsequent images of the comet, taken on February 22, 2013, 
astrometrically uncalibrated. The same frames are uncalibrated astrometrically, inviting you 
to have the fun of doing it yourself! The comet is a small smudge in the centre of the field,
though a small tail appeared.

FebAstCalibrated.tgz: two frames of the comet taken on February 22, 2013 (first and last in
series) that are astrometrically calibrated. 

MayUncalib.tgz: four subsequent images of the comet, taken on May 01, 2013, astrometrically
uncalibrated.

SeptUncalib.tgz: five subsequent images of the comet, taken on September 08, 2013,
astrometrically uncalibrated.

OctUncalib.tgz: three subsequent images of the comet, taken on October 03, 2013, astrometrically 
uncalibrated. Here the telescope was tracking the comet, therefore the stars are trailed. 

OctCalib.tgz: two frames of the comet taken (first and last) that are astrometrically calibrated.
